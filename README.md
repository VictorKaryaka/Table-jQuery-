# jQuery
Create a table 10x10 (10 columns and 10 rows). Fill table cells with some texts. Place a form on the page with text input and checkbox. Text input should be used to find text in the table. Matched text should be highlighted. Checkbox should be used as a switcher to display or not table rows where text was not found.
Solve this task using jQuery. Utilize OOP.
